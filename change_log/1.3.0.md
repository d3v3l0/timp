## Add function to handle parent thread request

#### `(timp-server-process-data-maybe)`

This function only applies to dark packages.

Thinking of a very long function like this:

``` elisp
(defun my-func ()
  (dotimes (var 1000000)
    ;; Jobs here
    ))
```

During the excution, the thread cannot respond to any request from the parent thread.
By adding `(timp-server-process-data-maybe)`, request from parent thread can be handled.

``` elisp
(defun my-func ()
    (dotimes (var 1000000)
      (timp-server-process-data-maybe)
      ;; Jobs here
    ))
```
